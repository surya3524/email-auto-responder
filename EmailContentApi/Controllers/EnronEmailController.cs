Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2001 10:30:00 -0500

Ken,

I wanted to update you on our Q4 natural gas trading performance. We've seen significant volatility in the markets, particularly in the California region.

Current positions:
- Long 50,000 MMBtu at $4.25
- Short 25,000 MMBtu at $4.75
- Options portfolio showing $2.3M in unrealized gains

The weather forecast suggests colder temperatures in the Northeast, which should support prices. I recommend we hold our long positions through the end of the month.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

Jeff,

I've completed the analysis of our Special Purpose Entity structures for Q4. Here's the summary:

Chewco Investments:
- Asset value: $1.2B
- Debt: $800M
- Expected earnings impact: $150M

LJM partnerships:
- Total assets: $2.1B
- Off-balance sheet treatment confirmed

The auditors have reviewed and approved these structures. We should be able to meet our earnings targets with these arrangements.

Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2001 09:00:00 -0500

Dear Enron Employees,

I want to address the recent concerns about our company's performance and stock price. Enron remains fundamentally strong with excellent growth prospects.

Our core businesses continue to perform well:
- Energy trading volumes up 35% year-over-year
- Broadband division making significant progress
- International projects on track

The recent stock price decline is temporary and doesn't reflect our true value. I have full confidence in our business model and our team.

We will continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders and maintaining our position as the world's leading energy company.

Best regards,
Ken Lay

Andy,

I've reviewed the legal documentation for the LJM partnerships. Here are my findings:

1. The partnership structures appear to comply with GAAP requirements
2. Independent third-party investors provide sufficient economic substance
3. The management fee arrangements are commercially reasonable

However, I recommend we:
- Document all board approvals more thoroughly
- Ensure proper disclosure in our SEC filings
- Consider additional independent legal review

The board will need to approve these structures at the next meeting.

Jeff,

The California power market situation is becoming critical. Here's the latest:

Current market conditions:
- Spot prices reaching $1,000/MWh in some areas
- Rolling blackouts affecting major cities
- Regulatory pressure increasing

Our positions:
- Long 500MW of generation capacity
- Forward contracts at $75/MWh average
- Significant upside potential

I recommend we:
1. Increase our generation commitments
2. Accelerate our trading activities
3. Prepare for regulatory scrutiny

This could be a major opportunity for Enron.

We remain committed to our employees and will provide support during this transition period.

Ken,

I wanted to update you on our Q4 natural gas trading performance. We've seen significant volatility in the markets, particularly in the California region.

Current positions:
- Long 50,000 MMBtu at $4.25
- Short 25,000 MMBtu at $4.75
- Options portfolio showing $2.3M in unrealized gains

The weather forecast suggests colder temperatures in the Northeast, which should support prices. I recommend we hold our long positions through the end of the month.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

Jeff,

I've completed the analysis of our Special Purpose Entity structures for Q4. Here's the summary:

Chewco Investments:

- Debt: $800M
- Expected earnings impact: $150M

The auditors have reviewed and approved these structures. We should be able to meet our earnings targets with these arrangements.

Dear Enron Employees,

I want to address the recent concerns about our company's performance and stock price. Enron remains fundamentally strong with excellent growth prospects.

Our core businesses continue to perform well:
- Energy trading volumes up 35% year-over-year
- Broadband division making significant progress
- International projects on track

The recent stock price decline is temporary and doesn't reflect our true value. I have full confidence in our business model and our team.

We will continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders and maintaining our position as the world's leading energy company.

Best regards,
Ken Lay

Andy,

I've reviewed the legal documentation for the LJM partnerships. Here are my findings:

1. The partnership structures appear to comply with GAAP requirements
2. Independent third-party investors provide sufficient economic substance
3. The management fee arrangements are commercially reasonable

However, I recommend we:
- Document all board approvals more thoroughly
- Ensure proper disclosure in our SEC filings
- Consider additional independent legal review

The board will need to approve these structures at the next meeting.

Jeff,

The California power market situation is becoming critical. Here's the latest:

Current market conditions:
- Spot prices reaching $1,000/MWh in some areas
- Rolling blackouts affecting major cities
- Regulatory pressure increasing

Our positions:
- Long 500MW of generation capacity
- Forward contracts at $75/MWh average
- Significant upside potential

I recommend we:
1. Increase our generation commitments
2. Accelerate our trading activities
3. Prepare for regulatory scrutiny

This could be a major opportunity for Enron.

We remain committed to our employees and will provide support during this transition period.
