Dear Customer Support Team,

I'm writing regarding my recent order (#12345) that was delivered on Monday. Unfortunately, one of the items arrived damaged.

The product was the wireless headphones, and the right earpiece is completely non-functional. I've attached photos of the damage for your reference.

I would appreciate if you could help me with a replacement or refund. I'm available to discuss this further at your convenience.

Thank you for your time.

Hi Development Team,

I'm working on integrating your API into our system and have a few technical questions:

4. Is there a sandbox environment for testing?

I've reviewed the documentation but would appreciate some clarification on these points.
